## Notes
- Build Together is meant to be challenging. You will be asked to figure things out with your team. Sr. Dev will guide you but not a full outline of what you should be doing. Asking questions is the more important thing.
- You can use other resources but donâ€™t just copy it word for word. You should be able to explain what your code is doing.
- Team members are meant to keep each other accountable, but if a team member is not pulling their weight, they will be cut.
